1 Introduction


Chess is one of the world's most widely recognized and influential board games. Achieving mastery in chess demands an tremendous amount of time, dedication, and skill, and throughout history, being a chess master has been associated with high intellect and a strategic mind. In the 20th century, computers entered the competition and in 1996 a computer was crowned world champion in chess for the first time. Ever since then, chess engines have become increasingly stronger and more powerful. Today, modern computers can perform billions of computations per second but despite this, chess remains unsolved â€” meaning no definitive strategy guarantees victory in every scenario. The vast number of possible positions quickly escalates toward infinity, rendering even billions of computations insufficient for a solution.
To address this complexity, computers traditionally rely on algorithms and decision trees to prioritize certain moves and disregard others. However, with advancements in artificial intelligence, modern engines have become significantly more sophisticated implementing neural networks. The goal of this project is to develop a chess engine entirely based on a neural network and to evaluate its performance.
